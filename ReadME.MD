# OpenAI ChatGPT-4 Integration using Nodejs and expressjs

This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 model with an Express server to create and manage conversations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- OpenAI API Key

## Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaheesAhmed/openai-chatgpt-api.git
   cd openai-chatgpt-api

   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   Make sure you have installed all necessary dependencies by using this command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
npm install

```

## Setting Up OpenAI API Key:

Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
You will use this key with the /setKey endpoint to initialize the OpenAI client.

## Usage

Start the Server:

```
npm start

```

## Set OpenAI API Key:

Make a POST request to /setKey with the API key in the body:
json

```
{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
}

```

## Start a Conversation:

Make a POST request to _/conversation_ with the required details:
json

```
{
  "instructions": "Respond to user queries",
  "messageContent": "Your initial message to GPT-3.5",
  "additionalInstructions": "Any additional instructions for GPT-3.5"
}

```

## You will get the full response object

```
